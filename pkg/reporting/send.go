	// ongoing calls to sendAllCompletedBatches, but (b) we don't want the bias towards lower
	// durations that comes with that.
	//
	// Here's some more detail:
	//
	// To make sure that long-running sendAllCompletedBatches() loops show up in the metrics while
	// they're still running, we want to periodically update metrics.lastSendDuration before the
	// loop has finished. A side-effect of doing this naively is that the gauge will sometimes
	// return durations that are much shorter than the *actual* previous send loop duration.
	//
	// In order to fix this, we store that *actual* previous duration in this field, but only
	// update the metric when either (a) the loop is done, or (b) the duration so far is already
	// longer than the previous one.
	//
	// This means that we remove the bias towards shorter durations, at the expense of sometimes
	// returning higher durations for too long. IMO that's ok, and we'd rather have our metrics give
	// a pessimistic but more accurate view.
