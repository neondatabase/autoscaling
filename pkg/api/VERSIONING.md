# API version compatibility

This file exists to make it easy to answer the following questions:

1. Which protocol versions does each component support?
2. Which releases of a component support a given protocol version?

The table below should provide the necessary information. For each release, it gives the range of
supported protocol versions by each component. The topmost line - "Current" - refers to the latest
commit in this repository, possibly unreleased.
