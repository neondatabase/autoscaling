# Autoscaling

Vertical autoscaling for a fleet of postgres instances running in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Quick access

Images are available as:

| Component name | Image name |
|----------------|------------|
| scheduler (and plugin) | `neondatabase/autoscale-scheduler` |
| autoscaler-agent | `neondatabase/autoscaler-agent` |
| VM informant | `neondatabase/vm-informant` |

The deployment files and a VM informant binary are attached to each release.

## Overview

We want to dynamically change the amount of CPUs and memory of running postgres instances, _without
breaking TCP connections to postgres_.

This relatively easy when there's already spare resources on the physical (Kubernetes) node, but it
takes careful coordination to move postgres instances from one node to another when the original
node doesn't have the room.

We've [tried a bunch](https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/issues/1651) of existing tools and
settled on the following:

* Use [VM live migration](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/migration.html) to move running
  postgres instances between physical nodes
* QEMU is used as our hypervisor
* [NeonVM](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonvm) orchestrates NeonVM VMs as custom resources in
  K8s, and is responsible for scaling allocated resources (CPU and memory _slots_)
* A modified K8s scheduler ensures that we don't overcommit resources and triggers migrations when
  demand is above a pre-configured threshold
* Each VM has a sidecar container in its pod (`autoscaler-agent`) that triggers scaling decisions
  and makes resource requests to the K8s scheduler on its behalf to reserve additional resources.

Networking is preserved across migrations by giving each VM an additional IP address on a bridge
network spanning the cluster with a flat topology; the L2 network figures out "by itself" where to
send the packets after migration.

## Building and running

Build everything:

```sh
vm_image/start-local-registry.sh # required for everything below. Does nothing on repeat
vm_image/build.sh
build/autoscale-scheduler/build.sh
build/autoscaler-agent/build.sh
```

We also require a local build of NeonVM (for now, as of 2022-11-27); which can be done by cloning
the repository, in a different directory:
```sh
git clone -b sharnoff/dev git@github.com:neondatabase/neonvm
cd neonvm  # ^^^^^^^^^^^^ NOTE: needs to be the right branch.

# as root:
CONTROLLER_IMG='localhost:5001/neonvm-controller:latest' \
RUNNER_IMG='localhost:5001/neonvm-runner:latest' \
./build_docker.sh
```

Download various dependencies:

```sh
scripts/download-cni.sh
scripts/download-deployments.sh
```

Set up the cluster:

```sh
scripts/cluster-init.sh
```

Run the VM:

```sh
kubectl apply -f vm-deploy.yaml
```

Run pgbench and watch the vCPU allocation grow:

```sh
scripts/run-bench.sh
# or:
VM_NAME=postgres14-disk-test scripts/run-bench.sh
```
