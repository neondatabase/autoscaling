## Environment

<!--
e.g. local development, staging, production
-->

## Steps to reproduce

<!--
If you can, try to reproduce the bug. If e.g. this occurred in production under
rare circumstances, indicate as such. Any related events can be included in the
later "Actual result" section.

If this occurred while you were testing, but you don't have logs for it, say
what kind of testing you were doing! Provide any scripts / commands that were
relevant.
-->

## Expected result

<!--
What did you expect to happen?

Try to avoid vague statements like "operation should succeed". Instead, say more
specifically what the success should look like (e.g. "VM should scale up").
-->

## Actual result

<!--
Remember to include logs, graphs, and other supporting information to show
how/why things did not function as expected.
