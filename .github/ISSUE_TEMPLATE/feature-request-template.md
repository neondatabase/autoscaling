## Problem description / Motivation

<!--
Feature requests are for when something isn't a bug (because there's nothing
*unexpected* per se), but there's still room for improvement.

This area is the most important part! Sometimes we think one solution is best,
but gradually realize that another is simpler. This is only possible if the
problem description is clear about what is *actually* required.
-->

## Feature idea(s) / DoD

<!--
DoD = "definition of done".

Put any ideas you have for how the changes should look *externally* - i.e. to a
user of the system or component that needs changing. For each idea, give the
DoD: "what external changes need to be made for the feature to be complete?"
-->

## Implementation ideas

<!--
If you have ideas about how the feature could be implemented, please share!

If not, feel free to remove this section.
