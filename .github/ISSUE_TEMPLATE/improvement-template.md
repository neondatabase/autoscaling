## Problem description / Motivation

<!--
Improvement are for when something isn't a bug (because there's nothing
*unexpected* per se), but there's still room for improvement. In contrast to
feature requests this is less customer facting but more of an internal cleanup
or improvement.

This area is the most important part! Sometimes we think one solution is best,
but gradually realize that another is simpler. This is only possible if the
problem description is clear about what is *actually* required.
-->

## Feature idea(s) / DoD

<!--
DoD = "definition of done".

Put any ideas you have for what changes need to be done for the improvement
to be complete.
-->

## Implementation ideas

<!--
If you have ideas about how the improvement could be implemented, please share!

If not, feel free to remove this section.
