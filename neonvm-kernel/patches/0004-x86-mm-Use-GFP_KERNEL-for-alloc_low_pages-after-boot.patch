Subject: [PATCH 4/5] x86/mm: Use GFP_KERNEL for alloc_low_pages() after boot

Currently it's GFP_ATOMIC. GFP_KERNEL seems more correct.

From Ingo M. [1]

> There's no real reason why it should be GFP_ATOMIC AFAICS, other than
> some historic inertia that nobody bothered to fix.

and previously Mike R. [2]

> The few callers that effectively use page allocator for the direct map
> updates are gart_iommu_init() and memory hotplug. Neither of them
> happen in an atomic context so there is no reason to use GFP_ATOMIC
> for these allocations.
>
> Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL to avoid using atomic reserves for
> allocations that do not require that.
