	// There's some fun stuff here. For general information, refer to `man 7 cgroups` - specifically
	// the section titled "/proc files" - for "/proc/cgroups" and "/proc/pid/cgroup".
	//
	// In general, the idea is this: If we start QEMU outside of the cgroup for the container we're
	// running in, we run into multiple problems - it won't show up in metrics, and we'll have to
	// clean up the cgroup ourselves. (not good!).
	//
	// So we'd like to start it in the same cgroup - the question is just how to find the name of
	// the cgroup we're running in. Thankfully, this is visible in `/proc/self/cgroup`!
	// The only difficulty is the file format.
	//
	// In cgroup v1 (which is what we have on EKS [as of 2023-07]), the contents of
	// /proc/<pid>/cgroup tend to look like:
	//
	//   11:cpuset:/path/to/cgroup
	//   10:perf_event:/path/to/cgroup
	//   9:hugetlb:/path/to/cgroup
	//   8:blkio:/path/to/cgroup
	//   7:pids:/path/to/cgroup
	//   6:freezer:/path/to/cgroup
	//   5:memory:/path/to/cgroup
	//   4:net_cls,net_prio:/path/to/cgroup
	//   3:cpu,cpuacct:/path/to/cgroup
	//   2:devices:/path/to/cgroup
	//   1:name=systemd:/path/to/cgroup
	//
	// For cgroup v2, we have:
	//
	//   0::/path/to/cgroup
	//
	// The file format is defined to have 3 fields, separated by colons. The first field gives the
	// Hierarchy ID, which is guaranteed to be 0 if the cgroup is part of a cgroup v2 ("unified")
	// hierarchy.
	// The second field is a comma-separated list of the controllers. Or, if it's cgroup v2, nothing.
	// The third field is the "pathname" of the cgroup *in its hierarchy*, relative to the mount
	// point of the hierarchy.
	//
	// So we're looking for EITHER:
	//  1. an entry like '<N>:<controller...>,cpu,<controller...>:/path/to/cgroup (cgroup v1); OR
	//  2. an entry like '0::/path/to/cgroup', and we'll return the path (cgroup v2)
	// We primarily care about the 'cpu' controller, so for cgroup v1, we'll search for that instead
	// of e.g. "name=systemd", although it *really* shouldn't matter because the paths will be the
	// same anyways.
	//
	// Now: Technically it's possible to run a "hybrid" system with both cgroup v1 and v2
	// hierarchies. If this is the case, it's possible for /proc/self/cgroup to show *some* v1
	// hierarchies attached, in addition to the v2 "unified" hierarchy, for the same cgroup. To
	// handle this, we should look for a cgroup v1 "cpu" controller, and if we can't find it, try
	// for the cgroup v2 unified entry.
	//
	// As far as I (@sharnoff) can tell, the only case where that might actually get messed up is if
	// the CPU controller isn't available for the cgroup we're running in, in which case there's
	// nothing we can do about it! (other than e.g. using a cgroup higher up the chain, which would
	// be really bad tbh).
