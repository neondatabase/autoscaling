Host *
    # If this flag is set to accept-new then ssh will automatically add new host
    # keys to the user's known_hosts file, but will not permit connections to
    # hosts with changed host keys. This allows to skip the annoying
    # confirmation when connecting to a host for the first time while not
    # comprosing security.
